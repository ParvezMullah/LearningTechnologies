## Introduction to azure data lake storage Gen2
### Introduction
### Understand Azure data lake storage Gen2
    a data lake is a repository of data that is stored in its natural/raw format, usually object blobs or files. azure data lake storage is a comprehensive, massively scalable, secure and cost effective data lake solution for high performance analytics workloads in the cloud.
    Secure, Performance, Data redundancy
### Enable Azure Data lake storage gen2 in azure storage
    1. Enable hierarchical namespace
    2. Data Lake Gen2 upgrade
### compare azure data lake store to azure blob storage
    1. blob storage
        / used as virtual folders
    2. azure data lake storage
        optimized for hirarchical namespace
### understand the stages for processing big data
    1. ingest
    2. store
    3. prep and train
    4. model and serve
### use azure data lake storage gen2 in data analytics workloads
    1. Big data processing and analytics
    2. Data warehousing
    3. Real-time data analysis
    4. Data science and machine learning
### knowlege check
