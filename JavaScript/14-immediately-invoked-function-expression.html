        1. It is a design pattern which is known as Self executing anonymous function
            and contains two parts.
        2. first is an anonymous function with the lexical scope enclosed within the
            grouping operator().this prevents accessing variable within the IIFE idiom 
            as well as polluting the global scope.
        3. Second part creates immediate invoked function (), through which the
        Javascript will directly interpret the functions.
